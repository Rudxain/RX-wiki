# $`P`$-ness
The "$`p`$-ness of $r \in \mathbb {Q}$" is defined as $\frac {|n|} {s - |n| + 1}$, where $s$ is the sum of all absolute exponents in the [canonical form](https://oeis.org/wiki/Prime_factorization#Canonical_prime_factorization) of $|r|$, and $p^n$ is the corresponding term in such canonical form ($n=0$ if the term isn't present).

## Examples
- the 2-ness (AKA "even-ness") of ±2 is 1, because $2=2^1$ and $\frac {1}{1} = 1$
- 2-ness of ±3 is 0
- 2-ness of ±1/2 is 1
- 2-ness of ±18 is 1/3, because $18 = 2^1 ⋅ 3^2$ and $\frac {1}{3-1+1} = \frac {1}{3}$
- 2-ness of ±4/3 is 1, because $\frac {4}{3} = 2^2 ⋅ 3^{-1}$ and $\frac {2}{2+|-1| -2 +1} = 1$
- 3-ness of ±192 is 1/7, because $192 = 2^6 ⋅ 3^1$ and $\frac {1}{6+1} = \frac {1}{7}$
