# _Silence Disguised as Words_
AKA *"Silence Disguised as Information"*, is a phrase I commonly use to point out the uselessness of un[falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) claims.

Depending on tone and context, it can be considered [derogatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative), as it can be used to mock/call-out people for talking [BS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit).

## Example
> Persons A, B, & C, are "Alice", "Bob", and "Carl" (respectively). They only exist in this example, not [IRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#As_distinct_from_fiction)

[Let's say, hypothetically](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lets-say-hypothetically), that Alice claims "all electric charges in the universe flip polarity, every **2 seconds**". Since electric-charges are only "positive" or "negative" with respect to their opposites, and all of physics works exactly the same regardless of electric-sign, Alice's statement is an *unfalsifiable hypothesis*. Alice doesn't know (or doesn't want to accept) that her dogmatic brain believes her hypothesis is a "fact".

Now suppose Bob says "I agree with Alice, but it's every **1s**, *not 2s*". Alice's and Bob's claims are _"compatible"_ despite contradicting each other. This is because Bob's and Alice's claims match every 2s.

Now suppose Carl says "It's **truly-random** intervals". This claim is **completely incompatible** with Alice's & Bob's, as the "interval" is no longer regular (according to Carl).

They argue for minutes, almost 1 hour, and nobody wants to admit they're wrong. Finally, they all go home, ignoring what everyone said.

All of their claims can be easily reduced to **empty statements**. In logic, every empty-statement has a negation that's "just as plausible" as the original, rendering both claims **useless** when it comes to explaining reality.
