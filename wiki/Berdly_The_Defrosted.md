# _Berdly The Defrosted_
![BTD battle sprite (animated). His heart (soul) is literally beating with determination. His eyes are "on fire". His halberd has a shiny eye. Overall,  everything about him looks frosted.](https://i.redd.it/spmvj3ja64s71.gif)

Is a fanon ([AFAWK](https://acronymfinder.com/As-Far-As-We-Know-(AFAWK).html)) transformation of [Berdly](https://deltarune.wiki/w/Berdly), created by the [DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltarune) community/fandom. [citation needed]

I say "AFAWK", because

  future DR chapters may bring back Berdly, **even after Snowgrave**. Snowgrave is supposed to be a ["fatal"](https://deltarune.wiki/w/SnowGrave#:~:text=fatal) spell, but he's just comatose.

The transformation itself and its design, are both heavily inspired by [UTU](https://undertale.wiki/w/Undyne_the_Undying)
