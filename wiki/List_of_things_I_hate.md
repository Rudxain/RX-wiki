# List of things I hate
Despite liking almost anything, and being apathic to everything else, there's still stuff I hate! This is a list of such stuff, organized by categories for easy navigation, sorted from **"WORSE THAN SHIT"** (top) to *"unacceptable, but ignorable"* (bottom). Top#0 is reserved for **"BEYOND HATED!!!"**

> **NOTICE**
> Keep in mind I don't necessarily hate the people that belong to these. *"Respect people, not concepts"*. I can despise a group, but I have the empathy to understand that some people are forced to work/be there. Other people may simply belong there because they're too ignorant to see the flaws.

> This list is missing some justifications/explanations as to why I hate them; I will help by justifying later
