# Gold Pickaxe Effect
This psychological illusion (and sometimes fallacy) consists of believing that something has a shorter capacity than other thing, just because it has a shorter lifetime.

## History
The term was inspired by Minecraft gold pickaxes, whose durability-points are equal to wooden pickaxes, yet people think gold tools are less durable than wood ones, simply because gold has the best efficiency.

## Examples
This effect arises in places other than MC:

- When you have faster cellular data speed, you exceed the quota faster, but the data-plan had the same capacity.
- According to ChatGPT "Fast charging can increase the rate of chemical reactions inside the battery, which can contribute to wear and tear over time.". I assume the battery would wear the same "amount" regardless, but FC just accelerates this process. (if I'm wrong, please tell me why)
