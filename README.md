## ‚ÑπÔ∏èAbout
This is a mixed-language hybrid between encyclopedia, dictionary, and glossary.

## Purposes
- Define my made-up words (dictionary)
- Disambiguate acronyms (glossary)
- Explain objects/concepts in-depth (encyclopedia).

It has all the features you'd expect from such a hybrid, except a search-engine, I'm sorry :(

## Disclaimer
This **isn't [UD](https://urbandictionary.com), nor a Fandom/Wikia competitor.** This is *its own thing*.

The only allowed articles here, are the ones that explain stuff about me or my content (any multi-media, including text and programs). I don't have time nor cognitive-bandwidth to deal with 3rd-party/[BP](wiki/Broad-party.md) terms.

Nah, just kidding ü§°

Edits to existing articles are welcome!

However, you should only propose new articles if I forgot to explain something that's *"uniquely-tied to me"*. It doesn't *have* to be extremely unique, just something that's related-enough. For example [SDaW](wiki/Silence%20Disguised%20as%20Words.md) is public-domain (and I'm not the 1st to coin a similar phrase), but *I use it relatively frequently*, and I invented **my own example.**
