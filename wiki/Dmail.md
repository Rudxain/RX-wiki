# Dmail
**Digital mail**. What people actually mean when they say "[E-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email)".

"D-mail" is a future-proof and correct term; as the physical medium (for data transfer) is irrelevant to dmail protocols.

Consider [dial-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access): in "thy olden days" "email" was actually _"amail"_ ([acoustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics) mail). And the existence of fiber-optics turns "email" into _"pmail"_ ([photonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonics) mail). The only constant in all cases, is that mail is encoded digitally.

You should only use the physically-specific terms when the medium actually matters and/or needs disambiguation
