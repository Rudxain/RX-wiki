# Non-code linter
AKA "Anything can be a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) if you squint your eyes".

This is a generalization of source-code linters.

## Examples
- Android's Digital Wellbeing is a digital health linter
- Samsung Health is a human life linter
- Melodyne is a melodic linter
- Windows has its own set of system linters, which check for hardware and software problems such as: low storage, low performance, low battery, malware, etc. Windows also suggests tools and actions to its users, making the system itself a "user linter"
