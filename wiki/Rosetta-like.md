# Rosetta-like
A collection (Array/List, Tuple, Set, Enum, etc...) of items, where each item expresses the same concept in a different language. The lang can be written, drawn, spoken, or represented in any way that's "valid" for the given lang.

## History
The concept is a generalization of [RC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), which itself takes inspiration from [RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_stone) and extends it.
