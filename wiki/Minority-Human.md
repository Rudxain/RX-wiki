# Minority-Human
Is a fictional character whose "superpower" is to **belong to every marginalized minority**, especially those that are unfairly negatively-discriminated.

This superpower causes MH to "evolve" depending on present-day cultural factors.

## Traits
As of year 2024, some known characteristics of MH are:

- dark-skinned
- woman
- queer LGBTQ+
- autistic
- atheist
- night owl
- etc...

## History
I just invented the character as a joke, but I think it may be entertaining/interesting to take it seriously, for satire purposes.

## Story
There is no story, back-story, or character development. MH is a "regular" non-average human

## Disclaimer
This is **not meant to mock** minorities. It's just a silly joke about excessive marketing woke-ness in media
