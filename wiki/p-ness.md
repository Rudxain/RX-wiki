# $`P`$-ness
The "`p`-ness" of `r` ∈ ℚ is defined as `|n| / (s - |n| + 1)`, where `s` is the sum of all absolute exponents in the [canonical form](https://oeis.org/wiki/Prime_factorization#Canonical_prime_factorization) of `|r|`, and `p^n` is the corresponding term in such canonical form (`n=0` if the term isn't present).

## Examples
- the 2-ness (AKA "even-ness") of ±2 is 1, because 2=2^1 and 1/1 = 1
- 2-ness of ±3 is 0
- 2-ness of ±1/2 is 1
- 2-ness of ±18 is 1/3, because 18 = 2^1 ⋅ 3^2 and 1/(3-1+1) = 1/3
- 2-ness of ±4/3 is 1, because 4/3 = 2^2 ⋅ 3^-1 and 2/(2+|-1| -2 +1) = 1
- 3-ness of ±192 is 1/7, because 192 = 2^6 ⋅ 3^1 and 1/(6+1) = 1/7

## Name
"p-ness" has similar pronunciation to "penis" in english, and (coincidentally) "penes" in spanish. This was unintentional, but now it's intentional, because "funi"
