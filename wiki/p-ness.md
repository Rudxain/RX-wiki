# `P`-ness
The "`p`-ness of `r`" is defined as `n / (s+1)`, where `n` is the exponent of `p`, and `s` is the sum of all absolute exponents in the prime factorization of `r` (excluding `n`).
`r` must be rational, otherwise the p-ness is undefined.

## Examples
- the 2-ness (AKA "even-ness") of 2 is 1, because 2=2^1 and 1/1=1
- 2-ness of 3 is 0
- 2-ness of 1/2 is -1
- 2-ness of 18 is 1/3, because 18=2^1*3^2 and 1/(2+1)=1/3
- 2-ness of 4/3 is 1, because 4/3=2^2*3^-1 and 2/(|-1|+1)=1
- 3-ness of 192 is 1/7, because 192 = 2^6 * 3^1 and 1/(6+1)=1/7
