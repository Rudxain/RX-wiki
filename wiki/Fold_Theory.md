# Fold Theory
The study of mathematical foldings, similarly to how [KT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory) studies knots.

Sadly, I'm not a mathematician, so I have no idea how to rigorously define what FT specifically/exactly is. It's obviously part of [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology), just like KT. Since KT also studies foldings, it could be said that FT is part of KT, but it doesn't _"feel"_ like this tells the whole story
