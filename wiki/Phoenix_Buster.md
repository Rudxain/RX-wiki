# _Phoenix Buster_

Is a fanon special attack that can be performed by [_**Defrosted Berdly**_](Berdly_The_Defrosted.md). Since, DB is itself fanon, this means **PB is [fanon^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)**.

This attack is heavily-inspired by [Susie's Attacks](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Susie#In_Battle).
