# Calpas Paradox
A word-play on [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager), it consists on the fact that **faith is the ultimate heresy.**

## Explanation
Dogmatic faith (in contrast to trust) is blind and deaf. People with faith are so convinced of their beliefs, that they have the delusion ([or is it?](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/sep/21/why-religious-belief-isnt-a-delusion-in-psychological-terms-at-least) _[[Vsauce music](https://youtu.be/TN25ghkfgQA) plays]_) that their beliefs are facts, regardless of what "God's Reality" objectively states.

Faithful people **don't care about the things they put their faith on**, they only care about the beliefs themselves. This implies theists **don't care about any deity**, they only care about their personal god (see: ["The Real God: An Epiphany"](https://youtu.be/-j8ZMMuu7MU) by `@DarkMatter2525`).

Therefore, having faith is absolutely heretic, so **infinitely heretic that not even the "Sin of Apostasy" comes close to it**.

The only way to stop being heretic as a faithful person, is to embrace science instead of dogmas, which requires abandoning one's faith, something extremely difficult for people that have been brainwashed when they were children.

## Irony
Some believers criticize "modern relativism". They say stuff such as "Nowadays, people don't care about the truth. They invent their own truths and ignore reality".

First of all, this has **always** been the case. Examples:
- Some people may not care about facts, and they get [easily persuaded by misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_earth_society)
- Others may be [too deep into philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism)
- And others may simply accept religious dogmas

The irony in all of this, is that every previous example wouldn't exist if relativism/subjectivity didn't exist.
