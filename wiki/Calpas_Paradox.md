# Calpas Paradox
A word-play on [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager), it consists on the fact that **having faith is the most heretic thing to do.**

## Explanation
Faith is blind and deaf. Faithful people are so convinced of their beliefs, that they have the delusion that their beliefs are facts, regardless of what "God's Reality" objectively says.

Faithful people **don't care about the things they put their faith on**, they only care about the beliefs themselves. This implies faithful people **don't care about any deity**, they only care about their idealized personal god.

Therefore, having faith is the most absolutely heretic thing, so **infinitely heretic that not even the "Sin of Apostasy" comes close to it**.

The only way to stop being heretic as a faithful person, is to embrace science instead of dogmas, which requires abandoning one's faith (something extremely difficult for people that have been brainwashed when they were children)
