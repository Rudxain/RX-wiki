# Dissolution of Logic
AKA "Escape to Philosophy" fallacy. It consists of abusing philosophy as a means to ignore logic. It involves using philosophical concepts in a way that undermines productive discussion.

Essentially, it boils down to _"What's the point of proving me wrong if the entirety of human knowledge is based on beliefs and implicit conventions?"_

## Examples
- When someone wants to "ensure everyone is on the same page" (not genuine understanding) by enforcing exaggerated specificity from all parties in a debate.
- When someone pretends to advocate for "rigorous definitions" in a trial, but instead becomes overly skeptical of everything anyone says, driving the trial off-topic, by questioning the very nature of reality and standard legal definitions.
- When someone does a "Reductio Ad Absurdum" fallacy, to dismiss an opponent's argument as having the same level of validity/truth.
- When someone exposes implicit (but clear) assumptions about a subject, pretending to "debunk fallacies", but with the intent to distract everyone from the main purpose of the conversation. Thereby casting unnecessary doubt and ambiguity.

## Common cases
- Religious believers using the ["False Equivalence"](https://youtu.be/e-2WZsP6LA0?t=350) fallacy to dismiss atheism as "just another belief system" (AKA "Everyone has faith!!1!11!1" braindead argument)
- Lawyers trying to defend someone who is "clearly guilty" by questioning all evidence and demanding "unambiguous statements" from witnesses.

## Motivation
Why would someone commit this fallacy?
- Maybe they fear facing the truth or consequences.
- Maybe they don't even realize they're doing it, and genuinely have no idea how to properly reason about a subject.

## etc
True skepticism involves questioning evidence with a reason, not being suspicious of everything to the point of derailing the process.

The most important characteristic of every skeptic, is to **question themselves**, not just other people and the environment. Otherwise, they're just a closed-minded double-standard person
