# Graphic Arithmetic
> This article is a **stub**.
> You can help by expanding it.

Arithmetic applied informally and loosely to graphical objects, such as icons.

## Examples
- Isotype + Logotype = Imagotype
- Isotype * Logotype = Isologo

Therefore, an imagotype is just the sum of isotype and logo (usually a simple [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation), while an isologo is a product (it's hard or impossible to decompose)
