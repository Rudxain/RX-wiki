# _Phoenix Buster_

Is a fanon special attack that can be performed by _**Defrosted Berdly**_. Since, [AFAWK](https://acronymfinder.com/As-Far-As-We-Know-(AFAWK).html), DB is itself fanon, this means **PB is [fanon^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)**. I say "AFAWK", because <details><summary>(spoiler)</summary>

  future DR chapters may bring back Berdly, **even after Snowgrave**. Snowgrave is supposed to be a "lethal" spell, but we don't know exactly how.
