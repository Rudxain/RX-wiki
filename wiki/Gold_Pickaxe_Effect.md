# Gold Pickaxe Effect
You probably know that Minecraft gold pickaxes have the worst durability ever. But did you know their durability-points are the same as wooden pickaxes?

This happens just because gold pickaxes have the best efficiency (with some caveats).

This "illusion" is what I call, "The Gold Pickaxe Effect" (GPE for short).

## Examples
This effect arises in places other than MC:

- When you have faster cellular data speed, you exceed the quota faster, but the data-plan had the same capacity.
- According to ChatGPT "Fast charging can increase the rate of chemical reactions inside the battery, which can contribute to wear and tear over time.". I assume the battery would wear the same "amount" regardless, but FC just accelerates this process. (if I'm wrong, please tell me why)
