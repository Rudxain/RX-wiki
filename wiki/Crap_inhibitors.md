# Crap inhibitors

This is a list of tools whose main purpose is to *alleviate symptoms* of a "rotten" (evil) world. If people weren't bad, these tools would not be popular. They are **not a cure**.

The purpose of this list/set is to raise awareness, so that people try to find a real "cure" to the underlying systemic problem. Yes, this *is hard*.

## Content blockers
I'm including "debloaters" in this category because they have a purpose in common: remove/disable things you don't need/use (for efficiency and security) and things you don't want (to improve [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) and privacy)

Examples:
- [uBO](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (and its filter-lists). Because malware (including most trackers) and bloated ads wouldn't exist.
- [UAD-NG](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation), because it'd be possible to disable *any* app (except core system), and because all apps would be properly documented so that the user can make an informed choice.
- [Canta](https://github.com/samolego/Canta), because Android would have it built-in.
- [Droidrunco](https://github.com/lavafroth/droidrunco) / [Zilch](https://github.com/lavafroth/zilch). Same reason as UAD and Canta.
- [privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy/), because all bad "features" would be disabled by default.

> [!note]
> [AppManager](https://muntashirakon.github.io/AppManager/) not included, because it's an "all-in-one" (general purpose) app

It's worth noting that tools like uBO don't just "block malware", as it can be used to customize sites and pages. Tools like uBO would still be useful (but more niche) even in a world where evil didn't exist, simply because each user has different needs and preferences.

## Downloaders
Is it *really* too much to ask that publicly-available and "free" multi-media be easily fetchable? Streaming is just a concurrent download+playback, so downloading (without re-distributing) isn't "piracy"; providing a "Download" button (that _actually_ downloads a file that isn't [held hostage](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-sec15bfe098e/web) by [isolated-storage](https://source.android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox) and/or [DRM](https://consumerrights.wiki/index.php?title=YouTube&oldid=31465#Offline_video_DRM)) is a no-brainer. But nooo, we can't have nice things, so YT-DL and YT-Vanced (and etc...) were born.

A "download"-button is **the absolute minimum**. YT-DL exists because automated fetching is a thing, so media platforms should also provide APIs. And again, the **bare minimum** is a paid API (this is fair, because it deters bot abuse), but Wikipedia and GitHub provide free APIs (with rate-limits) so what's the excuse?

Examples:
- [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/)
