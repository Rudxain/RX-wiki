# _Phoenix Buster_

Is a fanon special attack that can be performed by [_**Defrosted Berdly**_](Berdly_The_Defrosted.md). Since, [AFAWK](https://acronymfinder.com/As-Far-As-We-Know-(AFAWK).html), DB is itself fanon, this means **PB is [fanon^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)**. I say "AFAWK", because <details>

    (spoiler)
  </summary>
  future DR chapters may bring back Berdly, **even after Snowgrave**. Snowgrave is supposed to be a ["fatal"](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Snowgrave_Route#Differences) spell, but we don't know exactly how.

This attack is heavily-inspired by [Susie's Attacks](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Susie#In_Battle).
